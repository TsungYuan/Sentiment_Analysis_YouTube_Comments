0.069,0.924,0.006,0.8718,Positive,"Apple's design decisions for products like the Magic Mouse and Mac mini have long been the subject of debate. Despite years of feedback, the Magic Mouse's charging port is still located on the bottom, which prevents it from being used while charging. The power button on the new Mac mini 4 is also located on the bottom, requiring the user to lift the device to turn it on. These decisions beg the question ‚ÄúDid Apple's design team ever consider alternative placements?‚Äù

At the core of Apple's design philosophy is a simple principle ‚Äùif a feature is not frequently used, it does not need to be emphasised‚Äù. This approach explains why aesthetic considerations are often more important than functional ones, with form taking priority over usability. This is a valuable lesson for designers, because sometimes developing elegant, visually consistent products means that certain functions have to take a back seat.

A closer look at user behavior confirms Apple's stance. The Magic Mouse can be used for about a month on a 2-hour charge, so it doesn't need to be constantly recharged. The power button is also rarely used by Mac mini users, so its placement is less critical.

Apple's approach challenges designers to question traditional priorities. Sometimes the design decisions we make are not even based on user research, but on an aesthetic vision to create a seamless, minimalist experience.",Ugy-jRM7tNabz039uUd4AaABAg

I am not buying any Macs until that happens because I cannot have such an expensive laptop or even Mac mini's with such a small storage in it and look for external storage every now and then to access my frequently used large files like 4k videos, Lossless Music etc. (Also it isn't flexible for many developers with large projects or any other people to plug-in external storage all the time).

IMPORTANT: Also it is not possible for upgrade the OS if you're running low on storage.

I use a Windows laptop from 2017 and it still performance good. I just had to switch the 1TB HDD factory config to 1TB SDD.

I don't enjoy having to switch between CTRL-key short-cuts and APPLE-key short-cuts. I guess my brain is just too smol and too smooth >___<

But if one were able to install Linux without too much of a thought, imagine what an amazing compile server this could be for Rust/C++/objective-c* programming language. So for indie developers, watch this space closely for a good Linux distro so that you can have one of the best deals in build servers? I dunno. But the issue is, no one needs a build server this smol, so the fact that an ITX PC would be bigger, not so bad, and that duct-taped-together AMD-/Intel-based ITX PC would probably jive more better with some stock mainstream Linux distro. But your mileage may vary. Just sharing my thought process.

* Use golang instead of Rust and you don't have to stress over compile time lol

This new M4 Mac Mini is going to be such an enabler for content creators. Between these indie filmmakers and greatness is basically the 10-gb ethernet upgrade for reliable truely-10gbit access to a file server where all their archived VODs are. Can you imagine people enabling their Final Cut or DaVinci Resolve with this baby? This combo will shuttle you right to Hollywood for a solid decade at 1080p or 4K output. No more need to deal with the State of Washington Mall Cop, Adobe.

Marques the reason I point out how important this is to content creators is that, like greenback novelist with a degree and no life experience--a content creator who isn't getting out there, traveling the world, interviewing real people, finding incredible perspectives that we in McMansions don't have--just b/c their Adobe Premiere machine won't travel on shuttle busses and regional flights--is a real shame. This is definitely an enabler. Even someone who is stuffing all that video editing power into a ITX box have two think twice--some regional flights are just too smol to even fit even the smol'est ITX box. That traveller does not have to think twice about the 2024 M4 Mac Mini. And that does mean something.

0.085,0.902,0.013,0.9881,Positive,"3:31 whenever you spoke about why you thought they placed the charge port for the magic mouse on the bottom of the device, you would say something along the lines that it was because whenever people take pictures of their computers, it would make the desk look cleaner because otherwise people would just keep the mouse plugged in at all times, meaning it would be attached to a wire, and Apple is trying to get rid of wires as part of their ""image"" or something of that nature, so it was more of a marketing thing to some extent. 

I think this is no different with the power button. Apple likely put it on the bottom of the Mac Mini not only for aesthetic appeal to the average person, who may not care about design, but to keep the brand front and center for anyone passing by your desk. A power button isn't exactly stylish, so it was previously placed on the back of the Mac Mini. However, they know that with the button in the back, the Mac Mini itself tends to be pushed to the back of the desk or even hidden. I believe Apple wants the Mac Mini front and center‚Äînot only as a constant reminder of their brand but also to encourage you to keep it on your desk where it‚Äôs easily accessible for daily use. Lastly, by placing the power button on the bottom, they make sure you interact with the device frequently, which keeps you aware of how compact and powerful it truly is. In a way, it‚Äôs a subtle design choice to remind you each time you pick it up just how much performance is packed into such a small, lightweight package.

I think the last notion is probably the truest out of all three, simply because I remember when Steve Jobs demonstrated one of the early iPad generations‚Äîand through several iterations after the first one, they kept using the word ""magical."" Even to this day, I look back at technology and how far it‚Äôs come over the past few decades, and it‚Äôs no small feat to go from a large CRT monitor connected to a massive tower that could only handle basic functions, to a sleek, lightweight device more powerful than the computers used for Apollo 11. That word ""magical"" still resonates with me, and I often think, ""God, this truly is magical,"" every time I pick up an iPad. I can imagine feeling the same way every time I pick up the Mac Mini, reminded that this tiny, powerful device is packed to the gills with incredible performance in such a compact form.",Ugzlt9n5X-0WkCYurW14AaABAg

0.1,0.836,0.065,0.9176,Positive,"Mjeah. Apart from it being a good deal at base level, it's just the typical Apple pricing stuff. Which just makes zero sense at all. 

Which makes it a weird piece of equipment. Sure they made it cheap so it would be the go to mac. But if you need just a little bit extra storage, gone is the competitive pricing... Or more ram, same thing. If you really want to be able to stretch the capabilities of the chip inside, you need to spend at least $1000+. Which if you would compare it to similar specced parts: buy a ryzen 9700x, rtx 4060, with a cheap motherboard, 32gb ram, high speed 1tb m.2 ssd and a cheap case and powersupply, just gets destroyed in terms of price to performance ratio. 

For the basemodel with the non pro m4 to have 32gb, and 1tb of storage, you already pay $1400. And the m4 pro model starts at that price... So it just is bad value. *Surprise*

If you are serious about productivity, longevity and general performance. Not to mention gaming. A pc is a no-brainer. It has always been like this and this system, while it's bottlenecked basemodel is price competitive, is no different apart from that... 

I know mac os is king. And I love it. But apple tax just makes their desktop products superduper not worth it. Buy smart, get a pc. ;)

Edit: just saw the Beelink SER9 in my yt feed. It is a serious competitor against the mac mini. Only 0.8 cm bigger...With a MUUUCH faster cpu, 32gb ram AND 1tb as basemodel... Sure it has a worse gpu. And the speakers aren't to write home about. But against the mac mini it DOES give you a 2.5gbit ethernet port, only one usbc 4 port BUT gives way more ports in general. Hdmi, displayport, lots of usb a, oh and they have thought about the powerbutton placement.... ALL FOR LESS THAN $1000

I think a lot of people (me included) pickup our Mac minis to plug things into them and with this smaller footprint if the button was on the back it would be easy to press it when picking it up since there isn't much room and apple would never put the button on the front or top so really there was only one place that wouldn't interfere when lifting the machine, the bottom.

I've been a software consultant for 50 years for Intel, AT&T, Bell Labs, Mayo Clinic, Amtrak and half the banks & investment houses on Wall Street. In that entire time, I've worked on scores of computers & operating systems from the old IBM 360/370, through MS DOS, Windows, UNIX, OS/2, Sun 3/50 through Solaris, HP-UX, a dozen Linux distos (I'm writing this on Kali Linux running on an $80 Raspberry Pi 5 credit-card-sized computer with 2 43"" UHDTV monitors, a 2 TB M.2 SSD ""hat"" on the card's PCIe connector , wifi, ethernet, bluetooth, 2 camera connectors & a full set of GPIO pins). I have another Pi 5 also running Kali with a 2-lithium-battery power ""hat,"" a ""power-over-ethernet"" hat  for use in offices, a power wall-wart, and a 1080p 7"" touchscreen. I can put it all in a waist pack & go portable. I've got a dozen different models of Raspberry Pis doing everything from providing my own home security with infrared detectors & cameras, functioning as a Pwnagotchi & acting as a secondary router that sits between my ISP-provided router & my intranet, blocking the ISP's backdoor into their router & running NordVPN for the entire intranet.

My new primary tower came with Windows 11 2H24 installed, but I changed the bios setting to boot from a thumb drive to install Ubuntu 24-04 (soon to upgrade to 24-10), which totally wiped the C: drive before installing Ubuntu. Windows never even booted up before it was gone! I now have 3 2-TB SSDs & a 2-TB spinner disk in the machine & 60 TB of external drives in a NAS set at RAID 1+0 for data integrity, a 14th generation Core i9 14900K chip with 24 cores running at 6GHz,  upgraded to 128 GB RAM & put in a gaming-style video card with a monster GPU & 3 cooling fans. I have an upgraded WiFi PCIe board that includes the newest Bluetooth & WiFi 6E that goes in today. Beat THAT, Mac. My Wife's laptop has Windows 11 (last year's version - we won't upgrade) because I can't convince her to learn even the Windows-friendly versions of Linux. The one computer I've never seen any professional developer using in all these years is a Mac (that's not entirely true - one friend's laptop was in the shop so he borrowed his son's Mac laptop, put a virtual machine on it & ran Windows in it to write & run his code). Only the art departments sometimes used Macs - because they are mostly artistic, but computer illiterate. They are way overpriced & inferior to too many other good systems at far cheaper prices. Apple has everything built in China & now Vietnam. When you buy one of their $600 phones for $1200 (everything is 50% profit), the money goes to a tax haven in Ireland, where they pay 2% tax to Ireland. Whenever a Republican gets into the White House, he declares a ""tax holiday"" and Apple moves a bunch of untaxed profit into the US. They have no allegiance to the US and pay NO federal corporate taxes, despite being worth $3 TRILLION. I knew the #3 Apple person who was in charge of designing the Mac desktop (stolen from a prototype done by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the late 70s - Jobs took a tour & said, ""That's the future of Apple as soon as we can do it & not get sued""). He told me that Jobs had such contempt for his own customers that when they were meeting to discuss using a 2-button mouse or a 3-button mouse like Sun uses, Jobs jumped up, slammed his fist on the table & said 'We are designing this computer for the sort of person who would have trouble telling right from left. We go with a 1-button mouse."" He even had contempt for the people who made him a billionaire. 

Macs DO make excellent expensive ""designer"" door-stops, you can skip an iPad across a lake for at least 5 hops, & iPhones make decent sinkers for deep-sea fishing, though. One ex-Mac creator from one of the original hardware development teams told me recently that, if he was crawling across a desert dying of thirst & came upon a new iPhone with a 5 bar signal and a full charge, he'd keep on crawling to his death rather than use it.

ie; because the Mac Mini is so compact, people might place it in poorly ventilated spaces, like small cubbies or tight desk compartments, which could increase heat and reduce the lifespan of its components. Putting the button on the back and bottom makes the idea of placing the mac mini in the above situation a pain to handle, so the user likely to choose a scenario better for Apple and the user

I see all Apple devices and software have lots of these guard rails. They don't demand you use it a specific way but do enough to curtail you in a direction, that to be honest, if you follow is beneficial and is in your best interest, which is kind of rare for giant companies like this.

It's cheaper, at around $1k for 32gb RAM and 1tb of SSD, but probably not as powerful as the M4. Geekbench measures for the Hx370 are all over the map, and it comes in a number of different TDP varieties, so you'd have to actually run the tests to get good numbers, but it looks like it might perform closer to an M2 in terms of CPU, but pretty close to an M4 in terms of GPU. But that's speculation. All I'm really saying is that this form factor is actually pretty common now in mini PCs (Minisforum makes similar machines too) and it would help convey your point that this is much more powerful if we had another reference point for comparing those numbers besides more macs. I know the folks who always buy macs mostly only care about macs, but there's more interest in the mac hardware this time around from those of us who don't usually use macs, both because Windows has been screwing around lately and because the Mac hardware has proven really good at AI stuff. Switching to Mac doesn't seem a whole lot more unreasonable than switching to Linux. (And I'd even regain access to Fusion 360.)

Anyway, thanks for your review. It's still all a little pricey for my tastes, but I really do like that computers are getting so small and powerful.",UgxaLUG2np2vO8QtzdJ4AaABAg

That way they can give the appearance of affordability because, sure, you can technically own one for cheap, but it will have the storage capacity of a device from 15 years ago. Storage is cheap now. Like, stupidly cheap. Apple wants to charge $200 to ""upgrade"" from 256GB to 512GB... I mean come on... At retail - RETAIL - you can buy 256GB of M.2 storage for less than $30 and 1TB for less than $60 (and you know Apple's cost for parts doesn't come anywhere near retail). For the $700 you would spend to get this with 512GB of storage, you could build one of those mini PCs with 2TB of storage, an i7 processor, and 64GB or memory.

A lot of the accessories you already have won't work with it (unless you find a workaround). There's no upgradability. The GPU is weak. So many productivity apps aren't available. Gaming on it sucks. 

Instead of making this version smaller, I wish they'd of put a card reader on the front, 1TB base storage, and put a batter inside of it so we could use it mobile. 

It feels like Apple handicaps each product in specific ways to make sure that people buy more products. Seriously, what's the point of having a phone, a iPad mini, and a full iPad? Why not just make the phone fold 3 times like the Chinese are doing?

One strong recommendation is to buy the barebones kits and add your own RAM and storage.  That way you can be sure you're using high quality components instead of whatever cheap Chinese stuff they have in the factory.  Then again, a lot of these do come with namebrand components, like Corsair RAM and storage.

0.109,0.851,0.041,0.9954,Positive,"About Apple computer pricing, Apple has historically priced their computers very high because it always sold something that no-one else was selling.   In the 1980s, it was the only one with a graphical interface.   Apple knew that if you did not want to use a computer typing command line, you would pay the premium Apple wanted to charge.   You can find many Apple internal documents where Apple specifically decided and knew that they could charge more than IBM compatibles.   Many  times Apple engineers wanted to build cheaper Mac to increase the market share, but management would artificially keep the prices high because they knew people would pay for that special thing that Apple exclusively had.   Then Windows became a good graphical interface and Apple struggled for a long time, until Steve Jobs made Apple cool and for a while that was the unique Apple thing that people paid a premium for.   Now, Apple has the most efficient SoC, delivering the fastest computers at the lowest voltage/longest battery life.   With the M4, Apple keeps up this long tradition of offering something that no-one else is offering, so if people want the top CPU, they will pay the Apple tax to get it.   But instead of just pricing Macs very high like before, the new thing that Apple is doing now is to price an entry level Mac at a very attractive ""Low"" price, but making sure that the entry level computers do not have enough RAM and SSD, and then charging you an arm and a leg to upgrade the entry level Mac to an usable level at a very high price.    So for example, Apple actually wants to sell you a Mac Mini for $1799, even though a comparable Windows PC is just $800.    So instead of pricing it at $1799, Apple makes an entry level Mac Mini priced at $599, but intentionally with low 8GB RAM (until recently, now 16GB RAM) and a very small 256GB SSD (still).    The unsuspecting buyer sees the $599 price, then when the buyer upgrades the RAM and SSD to something that he/she wants (like 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD), Apple charges $400 for the additional 16GB RAM and $800 for the additional 1792GB of SSD storage, so the buyer ends up paying the $1799 Apple originally wanted to charge.   To make this work, Apple designed the tech from the ground up so that you can upgrade RAM and SSD only from Apple by designing the RAM and SSD ""soldered"" into the SoC,  even when Windows computers with upgradable/removable RAM and SSD modules have shown to be actually faster than Apple's all-in-SoC design.    Apple has to build the tech from the ground up this way to have a plausible technical argument against the regulators, should the regulators complain that consumers have no choice to upgrade anywhere else.   It is amazing how Apple has become the richest company in the world by making something everyone wants, then designing a scheme so that they can charge a premium/Apple tax, escaping the regular market forces of competition so that they can make huge profits.    This way, Apple is double assured to make a huge profit, first by making products people want, then second by designing away the competition so that the technology does not work unless you upgrade only from Apple.    (PS: At least now, people can buy a Mac for $599, a bit crippled with just 256GB SSD, but at least you are not locked out completely from an Apple computer like people were, like back in the 1980s - 2000s, when people could not pay the Apple asking high price of $1799.   So I guess this is progress?   I just wish Apple would make just some reasonable profits, so that consumers can choose the computer they really want, and not be financially coerced into buying a Windows PC just because a comparable Windows PC is $1200, and any reasonable person cannot justify paying $1799 for the Apple computer,  knowing that you are paying $599 just in Apple tax.   Apple, $200 for a 8GB RAM upgrade, when 8GB RAM retails for less than $20?   $200 for 256GB SSD upgrade when it retails for less than $17.99?   $800 for a 1792GB SSD upgrade?  Just because Apple designed the tech so that it is impossible to upgrade anywhere else.   And Apple's soldered on tech is not even superior, almost all windows laptops that use removable/upgradable NVMe M.2 SSD storage have faster read/write speeds).",UgxTuxsgXazorjPW0X14AaABAg

The point should why this was not being done sooner, our phones now are as powerful as any PC, the only issue is with Operating System Architecture, and I honestly, expect that in next 5-10 years, we should have OS-less architectures, basically, no one need to be worried about what operating system it is. All applications will be OS independent and that should be the goal, in terms, of efficiency in Computing.

Marques, of all people, should appreciate why Apple might‚Äôve chosen to place the button there‚Äîconsidering their dedication to design.

For such a small device, placing the button anywhere else makes it nearly impossible to turn on *with one hand*. Put it in the front, and you‚Äôd have to hold the device with the other hand or twist awkwardly to press it. Place it on top, and you risk accidental pushes that could turn it off or put it to sleep unintentionally.

The bottom is the only logical, ergonomic, and safe spot. You can turn it on with one hand by simply pinching the device.

Think back to when Apple first put the iMac‚Äôs power button on the lower back‚Äîit was for the same reason. Any front placement would require an awkward hold or rotating the device.

So, the ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù here is actually that Apple has an excellent industrial designer who truly cares about human-centered design, much like Dieter Rams did. We‚Äôre fortunate they still take such thoughtful, design-centric approaches.",Ugyg19aoQEXtkMuYDRN4AaABAg

I bought the prior model for my wife for $175, it's noiseless and sits on her desk.  Although the power button is convenient, she never has to turn it off anyway so who cares.  It's 2 years old and works just fine. I don't even use the gigabit connector, 5G wifi is good enough.

I don't understand not being able to upgrade the storage. With modern M2 connectors, this seems to be designed to only increase revenue for Apple.  That being said, external  hard drives aren't that expensive and although they might be slower, most of the stuff I have is more for archival purposes that processing so it shouldn't be that big a deal.  I used to always upgrade my phone memory until I realized that if I just managed my phone better, the base model was good enough.

I see no reason to pay the outrageous 300% apple tax.  That being said, I'm sure it's awesome, Apple makes good products for very niche users or those with money to burn.
